# Nebraska-Livestock-Visualisation

This program collects in the Nebraska water export (in the form of corn, livestock etc) data and visualises it using the Google Maps API.
This program utilises PHP as the scripting language; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end work and SQL for querying the database.

This project is implemented in 2 phases, a high level description of which is as follows:

PHASE I
● Write the base PHP code to connect to the database and establish connection
● Query the database appropriately to retrieve the values
● Fetch the Google Maps API framework and 'modify' it as needed, that is, add the CSS and JavaScript components to it
● Using AJAX to pass the SQL values to AJAX and subsequently, pass it on to the necessary methods of the API

PHASE II
● Replacing the Google Maps API with an API that supports dynamic visualisation (such as arcs going from a place to another). A very good example of this is 'https://blueshift.io/flow-map.html'
● Make the front end look prettier
